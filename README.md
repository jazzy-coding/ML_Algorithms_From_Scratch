# Coding ML Algorithms from Scratch

Taking a look 'under the hood' of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms to gain a deeper understanding of how they work.

I will be documenting my work here, algorithms that I aim to cover at first are:

- Linear Regression (Done!)
- Polynomial Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Gradient-Boosted Trees/Forests
- KNN Regression & Clustering
- Perceptron Model (Done!)
- Gradient Descent - variety of variants...

and more to come!
